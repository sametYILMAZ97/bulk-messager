# BulkMessager

A MacOS application developed to solve the limitation of the native iOS Messages app which lacks bulk selection capabilities.

## Background

I created this MacOS App for my personal needs when I changed my GSM provider and needed to send a new number notification via SMS to all my contacts (both iOS and Android). Since the native Messages app doesn't support bulk selecting contacts for mass messaging, I built this tool to handle the task efficiently.
